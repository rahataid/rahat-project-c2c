This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."

For example, a relay address that filters function\n selectors won't filter calls nested within a {multicall} operation.\n NOTE: Since 5.0.1 and 4.9.4, this contract identifies non-canonical contexts (i.e. `msg.sender` is not {_msgSender}).\n If a non-canonical context is identified, the following self `delegatecall` appends the last bytes of `msg.data`\n to the subcall. This makes it safe to use with {ERC2771Context}. Contexts that don't affect the resolution of\n {_msgSender} are not propagated to subcalls."

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events.
