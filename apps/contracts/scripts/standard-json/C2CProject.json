See {ERC2771Context}.\n *\n * This forwarder operates on forward requests that include:\n *\n * * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.\n * * `to`: The address that should be called.\n * * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.\n * * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.\n * * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.\n * * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.\n * * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.\n *\n * Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high\n * throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of\n * transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among\n * multiple accounts.\n *\n * NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by\n * performing a call with empty calldata.

This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas,\n * and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on\n * behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user\n * acquisition cost.\n *\n * By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward\n * some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a\n * relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or\n * ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be\n * used to execute arbitrary code.\n */\ncontract ERC2771Forwarder is EIP712, Nonces {\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\n\n    struct ForwardRequestData {\n        address from;\n        address to;\n        uint256 value;\n        uint256 gas;\n        uint48 deadline;\n        bytes data;\n        bytes signature;\n    }\n\n    bytes32 internal constant _FORWARD_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\n            \"ForwardRequest(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 gas,uint256 nonce,uint48 deadline,bytes data)\"\n        );\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when a `ForwardRequest` is executed.\n     *\n     * NOTE: An unsuccessful forward request could be due to an invalid signature, an expired deadline,\n     * or simply a revert in the requested call.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
